# 24-Puzzle-Game
A Bash Script Project of My Operating Systems Course. The Game is played on 5-by-5 grid with 15 square blocks 1 to 15 and a blank sqaure. There are two boards in the game one we play at and other is th goal state we want to achieve. Our goal is to rearrange the tiles/blocks so that we are in order specified as goal state.
